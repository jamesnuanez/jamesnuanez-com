My name is James Nuanez.

I build software for the internet.

From design to deployment, I create fluid and intuitive user interfaces that
are fast, responsive, and accessible, and when I'm not making things from
scratch, I bring maintainability and stability to established codebases,
relentlessly removing the cruft, eliminating elusive bugs, and improving code
quality.

This is my website. It was built using GatsbyJS.
