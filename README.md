My name is James Nuanez.

I build software for the internet.

From design to deployment, I create fluid and intuitive user interfaces that
are fast, responsive, and accessible, and when I'm not making things from
scratch, I clean up codebases, relentlessly removing the cruft and finding ways
to make the code easier to understand, safer to deploy, and more performant.

This is my website. It was built using GatsbyJS.
